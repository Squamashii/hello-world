# hello-world
This is the first assignment here on Github. I'm not sure what all it will encompass, but I'm excited to get started!
A little bit about myself and my goals: I am a graduate of Animation Mentor's Advanced Character Animation program. I am looking into getting a degree, and am interested in focusing on rigging to be a character TD in the future.
